# SMACSS Guidelines
Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS. It's not a library nor a framework. It's a guide that teaches you how to write your CSS. It's used to help you write maintanable and understandable stylesheets for your projects.

1. Use CSS classes for your selectors
2. CSS classes should have semantic meaning
3. You should be able to look at class names and know what a module does
4. Modules should be designed without context

**Advantages:**
* Easily understand your your CSS months after you complete a project
* Onboarding is easier since new hires can easily find the parts of a page to modify
* 

### Base
These are your base styles where you define the default stylings for certain elements or classes on a page. **Layout rules should not be applied here**.
